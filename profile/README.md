# King Bong 🙉 Manifesto

> *Software should be open. Code should be shared. Knowledge belongs to everyone.*

---

## The Problem

Every day, developers use software they cannot learn from. Students study theory but never see how real applications are built. Talented people everywhere are locked out—not by lack of skill, but by lack of access to knowledge.

The best learning happens by reading real code. The best growth happens by contributing to real projects. The best software happens when everyone can participate.

**Closed source doesn't just hide code. It hides opportunity.**

## Our Declaration

### Software Should Be Open

Every line of code. Every architectural decision. Every clever solution and every ugly hack.

**Open** means you can **read** it—study how the professionals solve real problems.
**Open** means you can **learn** it—understand patterns, architectures, and trade-offs.
**Open** means you can **change** it—fix bugs, add features, make it yours.
**Open** means you can **contribute**—your code matters, your ideas matter, you matter.

When source code is hidden, knowledge dies with it. When source code is open, knowledge multiplies forever.

**We don't just build software. We build opportunities to learn.**

---

## Why We Build

Behind every popular proprietary tool is a set of patterns, architectures, and solutions that developers everywhere could learn from—if only they could see the code.
We're here to change that.
We take well-known software and rebuild it in the open. Not to compete. Not to replace. **To reveal.** To create living textbooks that anyone can read, run, modify, and learn from.

Every clone we ship is:

- 📖 **A learning resource** — Real code solving real problems
- 🔧 **A foundation** — Fork it, extend it, build something new
- 🤝 **An invitation** — Your contributions make it better
- 🌍 **A community** — Developers teaching developers

---

## The Open Source Advantage

Proprietary software is a black box. You use it, but you never understand it.

Open source is a glass box. You use it, you study it, you master it, you improve it.

```
Closed source:  User → Software → Output
Open source:    User → Software → Output
                  ↓
                Learn → Contribute → Grow
```

**When you can read the code, every project becomes a classroom.**

---

## How We Build

We embrace AI-assisted development with **Claude Code** because it lets a small collective ship fast. But speed isn't the point. **Openness is the point.**

Every project follows these principles:

- 👁️ **Fully transparent** — Every line of code visible, every commit public
- 📚 **Well documented** — Code that teaches, not just functions
- 🚪 **Contribution-ready** — Clear guidelines, welcoming community
- 🧱 **Built to learn from** — Clean architecture, readable patterns

---

## Join the Collective

We're not just building software. We're building a community of developers who believe in learning together and building in the open.

### We Want You If You:

- **Want to learn** — Study our codebases, ask questions, grow your skills
- **Want to build** — Pick a project, open a PR, ship real features
- **Want to teach** — Write docs, review code, help others level up
- **Want to create** — Propose a new clone, lead a project, shape the collective

### Every Contribution Matters

Your first PR might be fixing a typo. Your tenth might be a major feature. Your hundredth might be leading a project. 

**Everyone starts somewhere. Start here.**

---

## Our Principles

```
1. Open by default. Closed never.
2. Readable code over clever code.
3. Document everything—code should teach.
4. Welcome every contributor, regardless of experience.
5. Learn from the originals, build something new.
6. Progress over perfection—ship, iterate, improve.
7. The community owns the code.
```

## The Future We're Building

Imagine a world where:

- Every proprietary tool has an open alternative you can learn from
- Students can study real-world architectures, not just textbook examples
- Junior developers can contribute to production-quality projects
- The patterns behind great software are available to everyone
- A global community builds and learns together

**That's the world we're building. One open repository at a time.**
